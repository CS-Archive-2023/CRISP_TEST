## Program Overview ##

Given how quickly technology evolves, our program focuses on teaching you how to think strategically, ask the right questions and address cybersecurity challenges in any context. Courses in the MS in Cybersecurity provide you with comprehensive understanding and tools across the cybersecurity domain, including:

- Protecting security information systems and infrastructure
- Detecting, countering, recovering, and preventing cyber incidents
- Ensuring availability and integrity of data resources
- Assessing security risk across information systems

Your learning will be reinforced with practical, hands-on projects with industry partners, giving you several opportunities to apply your skills in real-world settings. A previous background in computer science or cybersecurity is not required to apply. If you have previous coursework in computer science theory and systems, it will take you less time to complete your degree. Once admitted, you will take a placement exam to ensure you have mastery of the foundational concepts to ensure success in the program. If you do not have previous coursework in these subjects, you’ll take four bridge courses that will serve as a foundation for your cyber security courses. Passing the bridge courses with a 3.0 GPA is required to continue on in the program. 12 Courses (48 Credits)

## Cybersecurity Coursework Requirements - Ten Courses – 40 Credits ##

An overview of our cyber security program is given below. For most courses, details are available at the link(s) specified.

(note: courses listed in the recommended order students will take them in)

### Introductory Bridge Courses (16 credits if required) ###

Our bridge courses are intended to give students with limited computer science background an introduction to computer organization, programming, and related math required for the cyber security degree program. It is infeasible to gain the equivalent of a 4 year bachelors degree in computer science in just two quarters (20 weeks), so our bridge courses give students the fundamentals that they will build on throughout the rest of the program.

| Course Title | Quarter Taken | Details |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| COMP 3001 Bridge Course I: C++ I | Fall year 1 | [COMP-3001](comp-3001) |
| COMP 3003 Bridge Course III: Computer Organization | Fall year 1 | [COMP-3003](comp-3003) |
| COMP 3002 Bridge Course II: C++ II | Winter year 1 | [COMP-3002](comp-3002) |
| COMP 3004 Bridge Course IV: Discrete Math/Algorithm | Winter year 1 | COMP-3004 |

### Program-Specific Courses ###

| Course Title | Quarter Taken | Details |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| COMP 4370 Algorithmic Problem Solving | Spring year 1 | [COMP-4370](comp-4370/) |
| COMP 4355 Advanced Systems Programming | Spring year 1 | [COMP-4355](comp-4355) |
| COMP 4723 Ethical Hacking | Summer year 1 | [COMP-4723](comp-4723) |
| COMP 3361 Operating Systems | Summer year 1 | [COMP-3361](comp-3361) |
| COMP 4621 Computer Networking | Fall year 2 | [COMP-4621](comp-4621) |
| COMP 4724 System Security Management | Fall year 2 | COMP-4724 |
| COMP 4721 Computer Security | Winter year 2 | [COMP-4721](comp-4721) |
| COMP 3731 Computer Forensics | Winter year 2 | [COMP-3731](comp-3731) |
| COMP 4384 Secure Software Engineering | Spring year 2 | [COMP-4384](comp-4384) |
| COMP 4722 Network Security | Spring year 2 | [COMP-4722](comp-4722) |
| COMP 3904 Internship/Co-Op in Computing 1-8 credits | Summer year 2 | COMP-3904 |
| COMP 4799 Capstone Project | Summer year 2 | [COMP-4799](comp-4799) |


The program includes cyber security Development Coursework Requirements - 8 Credits from a combination of the following:

COMP 3904 Internship/Co-Op in Computing 1-8 credits
COMP 4995 Independent Research 1-8 credits
COMP 4991 Independent Study 1-8 credits
COMP 4799 Capstone Project* 4 credits

*Capstone Project – Required

Typical students take 4 credits of the internship/co-op course to gain on-the-job experience, and 4 credits of the capstone (required). In the case that an internship is not available, independent study or other elective courses may take the place of that requirement.


While the courses listed above are the recommended cyber security curriculum, on a case-by-base basis students may choose to substitute certain courses from a variety of electives, including: Introduction to Databases, Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms, Data Privacy, Data Mining, Network Administration, Cryptography, IoT Security, and various special topics courses. 


With an impressive mix of full-time university faculty, you’ll learn from instructors who are on the front lines of cyber security.
