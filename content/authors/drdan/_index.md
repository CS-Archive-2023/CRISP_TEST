## What I do ##
In my role as an associate professor of the practice in software development and architecture I am continually looking for opportunities to engage with students, and apply my 13 years of industry experience towards mentoring and helping them find jobs. I have hosted students at Comcast, my former industry employer, and written recommendations for students to help them pursue jobs and internships. Also, I have overseen several Independent Study courses for students to allow them the flexibility to learn new material while accommodating their unique scheduling requirements. My research areas include cybersecurity and machine learning, and I am interested in applying machine learning to application security. I teach Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity classes for the department.

## Specialization(s) ##
- computer networking 
- cybersecurity

## Professional Biography ##
Hello there! I'm Professor Daniel Pittman, an Associate Professor of the Practice in Software Development and Architecture in the Department of Computer Science. I worked in the software industry for 13 years, most recently as a principal software architect, and have just recently started a full-time position at DU! I received my PhD in Computer Science from DU in 2012. The focus of my research was modeling player movement within MMORPGs and creating cheat-proof gameplay algorithms in peer-to-peer multiplayer games. I've been a TA for the department several times since joining the university in 2005, and have been teaching at DU since the summer quarter of 2017. Since joining DU, I have taught Web Programming I, Web Programming II, Web Programming III (Web Projects), NoSQL Databases, Computer Forensics, and Machine Learning.
