abstract: Modern technology allows for the detection and identification of a vehicle
  passing through specific locations on a road network. The most prominent technology
  in use leverages cameras capable of high speed image capture, back-end extraction
  of plate numbers, and real time membership queries in multiple databases. Various
  parties have a vested interest in making use of the kind of data produced by such
  systems, in particular to deter risky driving, analyze traffic patterns, enable
  unmanned toll collection, and aid law enforcement agencies. In this paper, we proceed
  to assess the mass surveillance potential arising from the type and frequency of
  data collected in these systems. We show that even when restricted to information
  only about the structure of a road network, one can begin to set up an effective
  network of traffic monitoring devices to infer the travel destinations of individuals
  up to a concerning level of precision. We develop a tracker placement algorithm
  to corroborate this claim, and provide a quantitative evaluation of the privacy
  risks generated by the network of trackers determined by this algorithm.
