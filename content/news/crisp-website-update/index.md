## Overview

We are pleased to announce that the CRISP (Colorado Research Institute for Security and Privacy) has been updated. Our previous website was built on top of an outdated CMS (content management system) which was infrequently updated. We are moving the site to a static site generator design using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Wowchemy](https://github.com/wowchemy). Our hope is that this will be a simpler setup that allows us to more easily keep this site up to date with the goings-on within the security folks in the DU CS department.
