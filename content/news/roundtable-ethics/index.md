Presented by Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative Collegiate Program at UCCS College of Business

DFEI Ethics Roundtables are held throughout the academic year and open to all UCCS faculty, staff, Southern Colorado Ethics Consortium schools and Air Force Academy faculty with the intent to share their best practices, classroom experiences, subject specific course materials, and address specific concerns. Roundtables provide UCCS faculty and staff along with invited guests the opportunity to hear about how others teach ethics and implement principle based ethics in their work or area of expertise.
